# Libraries

Extra libraries with separate functionality from the rest of eightfold, and which may eventually be forked into their own repositories.

* [stablevec](./stablevec) :: A growable array type with indices stable across removals/insertions.
* [hedron](./hedron) :: Generic data structures for storing 3D mesh data, and utilities for deserializing various mesh storage formats.
